/*----------------------
 Creation Behavior
 ----------------------*/



/*
 Adds a bulletin board with all of its note content to the data model. 
 
 Since notes are stored as separate entities, the implementation should 
 provide for recursive writing of all the notes in the bulletin board. 
 
 This method assumes that the content passed to it as NSData is verified 
 and is valid.
 
 This method also assumes that the bulletinBoard with the given name doesn't exist
 If the bulletin board name with this same name exists the details should be handled
 by the implementation. 
 
 */

/*
 Adds one note with name noteName and content note to the bulletinBoard
 with bulletinBoardName
 
 If the bulletinBoard specified by bulletinBoard does not exist, the method
 returns without doing anything. 
 
 This method assumes that the content passed to it as NSData is verified 
 and is valid.

 Update Behavior
 -----------------------*/

 Updates the bulletinboard with name with the given content
 
 The method assumes that the bulletinboard with the name exists. 
 If the bulletinboard does not exist an error should be occured. 
 
 The method replaces the bulletinboard info with the new one.

 Updates a given note with noteName with the content.

 If they don't exist an error will occure. 
 
 The method replaces the old note content with the new one.

 Deletion Behavior
 ----------------------*/

 Remove a bulletin board with the boardName from the root. 
 
 This method also removes all the notes that are contained in the bulletin board. 
 
 If the boardName is invalid the method returns without doing anything.
 
 This method is not responsible for deletion of the bulletin board structure in the 
 application.

 Removes a note with noteName from the bulletin board with bulletinBoardName.

 in the application.

/*----------------------
 Query Behavior
 ----------------------*/

/*
 Returns an Array of string with the name of all the available bulletin
 boards in the root.
 
 If no bulletin board exists the array is empty. 
 
 In case of any error in storage or retrieval the method returns nil.

 Return a NSData object with the contents of the stored bulletinBoard for
 the bulletinBoardName.

/*
 Gets the note contents for the passed bulletin board name and noteName.
 Returns an NSData containing the data for the note.

 nil without doing anything.
